| | dev | staging | prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deployment | rolling | blue/green (3 min bake) | blue/green (10 min bake) |
| Tasks (autoscaling) | 1–2, Spot | 1–2 | 2–6 across 2 AZs |
| Size | 0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GB | 0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GB | 0.5 vCPU / 1 GB |
| Database | db.t4g.micro, 1-day backups | db.t4g.micro, 1-day backups | db.t4g.micro, 7-day backups, deletion protection |

**Blue/green**: ECS starts the complete new version (green) next to the current one (blue), checks
it is healthy, switches the load balancer, and keeps blue running for the bake time. If the new
version fails, ECS switches back automatically.

**Autoscaling** keeps average CPU near 60 % (memory 75 %) between the min and max task counts.

**Logs**: `aws logs tail /ecs/devops94-idp-<env>-svc-shop-api --follow`
